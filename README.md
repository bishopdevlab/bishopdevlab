👋 Hi there!
I am a senior software engineer with over 19 years of experience and have worked as a developer, software architect and project leader in aerospace, defense and medical devices. Currently, developing ultrasound system in Samsung Healthcare.

I'm always contemplating to make better structure and code, and I am meticulous, so I make an effort to secure the stability of the code by verifying the code I am writing with unit tests and various scenarios.

I'm also interested in the technology trends, so I am interested in 3D engine, web, mobile, and AI technologies.
I am a developer who enjoys learning and is happy to live as a software engineer.
